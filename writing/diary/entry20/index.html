<p>1:01 AM, 11/16/16</p>
<p>I realized that I’ve become much more arrogant since I came to UMass. I constantly feel like I’m right in engineering or physics, and I think that the answers to solutions and everyone else’s answers are wrong (sometimes). I’ve begun to look down on everyone because I think I’m smarter than everyone, but I’m not. I feel like this arrogance is tearing me apart, and I wish I’d revert back to my old self about a month ago, where I continuously questioned whether my solution was right. I feel like this atmosphere is tearing me up, and I somewhat wish I’d go to a place where I know the majority of people are ten times smarter than me, and that I’ll always be able to learn something from somebody else.</p>
<p>More importantly, on that topic, I’ve still been thinking about the MIT community, and how everyone seems to be super dedicated into increasing their own knowledge, like Willy. I’ve been thinking about trying to apply to graduate school there, but I really question whether I’ll make it or not. It almost feels like if I don’t belong in that community, as if I weren’t fit for such an enlightening community. Yet, it’s still something I always long for, and it’s a dream that I wish to accomplish. So, whenever I have exams coming up, or essays to write, I think of MIT, and how those exams help me strive towards the one dream school I wish to attend. I feel like MIT only accepts near perfect students, as well as people who are highly dedicated towards their own work. And based off of that, I don’t know how I could possibly change myself to cater towards that type of atmosphere, which was why I was saying that I possibly just don’t fit in at all. I’m worried about my future, because it’s a goal that I really strive towards.</p>
<p><strong>Note (11:19pm, 12/29/20):</strong></p>
<p>As much as it&rsquo;s embarrassing to share this entry (and future entries about myself fangirling (fanboying?) over MIT), I included this entry on my website because this obsession over MIT was a huge part of my identity back then. I think it&rsquo;s kinda funny looking back at myself – I struggled to keep up with my friends in high school, and as soon as I got into college (where things were a little easier), I thought I was a hotshot. Hence, my arrogance – I thought I was better than everyone else, and I hated my life at UMass because of that; I thought that I needed to be at a &ldquo;better&rdquo; school. I was delusional (honestly, I still am lol), but yeah, while I embarrassingly admit about this obsession, I own up to it because I think it really shows how naïve I was back then. I don&rsquo;t remember if I say this later in my diary, but I eventually grew to like my time at UMass – sure, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t <em>the</em> college experience I looked forward to, but UMass really helped me with my personal confidence; UMass helped me become who I am today. I don&rsquo;t think I could ask for a &ldquo;better&rdquo;/different college experience because I&rsquo;m grateful for all the things that happened to me</p>
