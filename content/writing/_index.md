I began a digital diary my freshman year of college. It was one of those things I started somewhat therapeutically – I often think too much and get into my own head, so writing acted as an outlet to all my drowning thoughts. But since then, writing became a way to express myself; it’s allowed myself to keep track of all my significant moments in life. The (recent) happy and sad, philosophical, nonsensical, heartfelt, and mentally hard/most depressing parts of my life – it’s all extant.

I hope you enjoy
