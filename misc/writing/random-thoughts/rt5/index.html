<p>As one of the adventures of adulting, I got baited over the excitement of the reduced price of my favorite vegetable last Friday. I mean intuitively, reduced price usually means that they want people to buy it cause it&rsquo;s going bad, but&hellip; that didn&rsquo;t hit me at the time&hellip; I was just like, &ldquo;dude I swear this is usually over $2/Ib&rdquo; and just got super excited that I saw it at like $1.89/Ib (I mean like also, is that really something to get super excited over?? lol). (As another note, I bought the vegetable the previous week and had the intention of buying it again this week, so I just got excited over the &ldquo;deal.&quot;) Well, here I am, cooking it almost a week later, and realizing that the smell is a bit off than usual&hellip; it didn&rsquo;t go bad, but it&rsquo;s definitely getting there. So I guess, now I know what it smells like for my favorite vegetable to go bad, and I also made a mental note to cook it all sooner rather than later so that I don&rsquo;t have to sadly throw out the food <em>after</em> cooking it (feels sad man). That was definitely the sad part â€“ noticing the smell was off while preparing the vegetable and then after cooking it, realizing that yeah, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t eat it&hellip; Well, at least it&rsquo;s not as tragic when I had to throw out like a FULL pack of chicken because I accidentally defrosted frozen cooking yogurt too early (to cook with the chicken), which ended up spoiling the entire dish I made (I don&rsquo;t make Indian food usually, but one of the dishes I like uses cooking yogurt, and I don&rsquo;t need a lot, so I froze the left over yogurt from a previous time that I made the dish)&hellip;</p>
